## About Me :
I’m a Backend Engineer with over 2 years of experience developing scalable, cloud-native applications with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and performance. At Deutsche Bank, I’ve driven key initiatives including legacy system modernization, microservices development, infrastructure automation, and CI/CD implementation using modern cloud platforms and DevOps tools.

With a B.Tech in Computer Science from IET DAVV and a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and system design, I’ve also solved over 750 problems across platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit — continuously sharpening my problem-solving mindset.

I’m passionate about backend architecture, clean code, and building systems that scale. Outside of work, I actively participate in hackathons, pursue certifications, and contribute to side projects that keep me learning and growing.
